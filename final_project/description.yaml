  Our project is a simplified version of Balatro. It currently supports a
  user drawing cards to make a hand and playing that hand to receive a score. 
  The user can go up to Ante 8 Boss Blind if they are good enough.
  The user interface is a TUI which prints the user's options in a friendly
  manner, asks the user to select a hand, and provides the score and type
  of the selected hand, as well as shopping options.

  Scoring is based on standard Balatro scoring.
